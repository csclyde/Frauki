Hey there. Welcome to the source code. If you're in here, I'm guessing you have some interest in the game,
or at least in game development. I left the sourcecode here, unminified, in a readable form, so that if you
are interested, you can take a good look. It's not beautiful, but it works decently well. You can even modify
the code if you want, and it should take effect when the game runs. Might be hard to debug, though. Anyway,
feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments. Thanks! - CLYDE
