		"Time to get to work Frauki. My Prism Gems are still out there.",
		"Frauki... Just where exactly have you been, hmm?",
		"Be a good little frog-girl and get those Prism Gems, now.",
		"Run along Frauki, my four Prism Gems are waiting.",
		"I really don't know why you left Frauki. Get back to work please.",
		"Please ask my permission next time you're going to leave like that.",
		"Be good and follow my directions Frauki. No misbehaving.",
		"Keep it up Frauki, you're doing a very good job.",
		"Well, I suppose you're well rested now. So you should have no problem getting my gems back.",
		"Ah, she decided to come back. How sweet it is.",
		"You haven't even gotten a single gem yet Frauki...",
		"...",

	welcome_back2: [
		"You've made some progress, Frauki. But there are still three Prism Gems out there.",
		"Looks like you're headed into the Tenements. Yuck. It's a mess down there.",
		"Be good now, go get some more Prism Gems. You can do it...",
		"Welcome back my little Gem Grabber. Go grab more gems for me...",
		"Down you go. Watch out for any little nasties down there.",
		"I haven't swept in the Tenements for years. Sorry if it's a little dirty.",
		"Did you have a nice break Frauki? That's good. Now be good and get back to work.",
		"One Prism Gem down, three to go... I think you might be able to do it Frauki...",

	welcome_back3: [
		"Two Prism Gems. That's very nice Frauki. That's... half... of them. Get the other two, please.",
		"Keep going Frauki, you're doing so good. I can't believe you got this far, actually.",
		"What a strong little slasher you are. I see you dodging and jumping like a little... frog.",
		"Be good and do everything I tell you, when I tell you to do it.",
		"Remember that you're working Frauki, not goofing around. So head right for the next Prism Gem.",
		"I can't wait to unleash a storm of destruction on those Alien Robots.",

	welcome_back4: [
		"That crashed ship will soon be destroyed. You just need to get one more Prism Gem...",
		"Don't let those Alien Robot clowns bully you, Frauki. Go slice them to bits. And stomp on their broken bodies.",
		"It's not enough to kill the Alien Robots. You must also make them afraid. Be good now and do what I say.",
		"Go to the Alien Robot's crashed ship and reduce them to scrap metal. It's fun...",
		"One more Prism Gem, Frauki. It's at the top of the Alien Robot's ship. Go up and get it please.",
